                    Coming from France, I have worked as a journalist and filmmaker for different print media, televisions,
                    institutions and NGOs from all over the world. I produce reports, short films, images films and
                    documentary films in different countries (Europe, India, Nicaragua, Swaziland, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana…).

                    As a Video Journalist, I have substantial expertise in all aspects of Video Journalism including
                    writing, interviewing, filming and editing. As a Filmmaker, I coordinate all the processes of making a
                    film (from an initial story idea, through scriptwriting, shooting, editing and directing). As a Video
                    trainer, I coach groups, help individuals in developing their media skills (how to use a camera, how to
                    write a video story, how to edit a film…)
