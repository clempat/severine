                <h1>About</h1>

                <p>
                    Coming from France, I have worked as a journalist and filmmaker for different print media,
                    televisions,
                    institutions and NGOs from all over the world. I produce reports, short films, images films and
                    documentary films in different countries (Europe, India, Nicaragua, Swaziland, Côte d’Ivoire,
                    Ghana…).
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a Video Journalist, I have substantial expertise in all aspects of Video Journalism including
                    writing, interviewing, filming and editing. As a Filmmaker, I coordinate all the processes of making
                    a
                    film (from an initial story idea, through scriptwriting, shooting, editing and directing). As a
                    Video
                    trainer, I coach groups, help individuals in developing their media skills (how to use a camera, how
                    to
                    write a video story, how to edit a film…)
                </p>

                <p>
                    As an Audio-Visual Coordinator with the European civil society organisation European Alternatives, I
                    coordinate both international teams and transnational film projects. I have also worked on the video
                    production and distribution strategy which supports their communications and advocacy goals such as
                    the promotion of democracy, equality, and civil society participation throughout Europe.
